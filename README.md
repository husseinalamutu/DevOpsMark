<H3> 👋 Hi there, I’m Hussein Alamutu - aka <i> DevOpsMark </i> </H3>
<h2> I'm a Fullstack Web Developer, Python Engineer currently in my final year for my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. 
You can check out my Twitter Page at <a href="twitter.com/alamzarts"> PyEngr & AI Enthusiast</a></h2>


- 👀 I’m interested in building apps that provides immense value, I mean a real life solution. 
- I love AI, IoT, I mean the possibilities attached to it. 
- I am kind of a multipotentialite, I have grabbed quite a stack of useful skills on my way - <i> Copywriting, Paid Ads Marketing, Funnel Building, Business Building and the likes. </i>
but I also love to niche down, no doubt I am a fan of marketing(the <i>Seth Godin</i> type), 
guess I have greater passion for computational thinking and seeing how a whole solution comes up from like hundreds of smaller solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking to  work at amazing companies as a fullstack(Html, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript and Django) or backend(Django) developer.
- 💞️ I’m also willing to collaborate on meaningful and impactful open source projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via husseinalamutu@gmail.com or message me on <a href="twitter.com/alamzarts">Twitter</a>
